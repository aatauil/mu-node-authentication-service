## Description
This service makes it easy to quickly setup an application where users can register and login to their account. It is made with the semantic.works framework in mind. The service is kept simple so you can easily extend it with your own functionality like 2FA. Tutorials on how to add add certain functionality will be made available in this repo's wiki in the near future. 

## Getting Started

### Add to your semantic.works stack
- Add the following service to your docker-compose.yml file: 
```yml
  authentication: 
    image: mu-node-authentication-service
```
- Add the following routes to your **config/dispatcher/dispatcher.ex** file: 
```elixir
  post "/accounts/*path" do
    Proxy.forward conn, path, "http://authentication/accounts/" 
  end

  delete "/accounts/current/*path" do
    Proxy.forward conn, path, "http://authentication/accounts/current/" 
  end

  patch "/accounts/current/changePassword/*path" do
    Proxy.forward conn, path, "http://authentication/accounts/current/changePassword/" 
  end

  match "/sessions/*path" do
    Proxy.forward conn, path, "http://authentication/sessions/" 
  end
```
- Create a file called **master-account-domain.lisp** under **config/resources** and paste the following code into the file:
```lisp
    (define-resource account ()
      :class (s-prefix "foaf:OnlineAccount")
      :properties `((:email :string ,(s-prefix "account:email")))
      :resource-base (s-url "http://mu.semte.ch/vocabularies/accounts/")
      :on-path "accounts")
```
- In your **config/resources/repository.lisp** file, add the following prefix <br>
 `(add-prefix "account" "http://mu.semte.ch/vocabularies/account/")`
- Finally add the following line to your **config/resources/domain.lisp** file
`(read-domain-file "master-account-domain.lisp")`
- When that is done, run `docker-compose up -d`
If you set this up locally then by default your app will be made available on `http://localhost:80`

### Frontend - EmberJS
If you use semantic.works then it does not really matter which frontend framework you use but for this Getting Started we will be using EmberJS as a template has already been build and is ready to be used.

- Clone the following EmberJS frontend https://github.com/aatauil/ember-mu-auth-boilerplate
- Navigate to the newly cloned repository and run `npm i`
- After that is finished, run `ember serve --proxy http://localhost:80`
- After your ember app has been succesfully served, you should be able to access the frontend in your browser at `http://localhost:4200`
More information about the frontend can be found in the [README](https://github.com/aatauil/ember-mu-auth-boilerplate/blob/master/README.md) of the frontend template.

**Note** <br>
The url entered after `--proxy` in the serve step needs to point to your backend in case you did not use the premade backend mentioned above.
